		<!-- Introduction -->
		<div class="prose prose-lg text-secondary mb-16 max-w-none">
			<p class="mb-6 body-lg leading-relaxed">
				I'm a <strong class="text-foreground">builder who happens to lead</strong>. With over <strong class="text-foreground">20 years</strong> in infrastructure and platform engineering, I've learned that the best technical leaders stay close to the work—understanding systems deeply enough to make good decisions and mentor others effectively.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-6 body-md">
				Currently at <strong class="text-foreground">{SITE_CONFIG.currentCompany}</strong>, I serve as the Directly Responsible Individual (DRI) for Multi-Region and Multi-Account initiatives—architecting systems that enable global scale while keeping costs and complexity in check.
			</p>
			<p class="body-md">
				My approach: design systems that multiply team impact. The platforms I build should make engineers more productive, not just keep infrastructure running. I'm happiest when I'm solving hard problems alongside a team, then watching them take those solutions further than I imagined.
