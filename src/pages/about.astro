                                I am a <strong>Senior Staff Cloud Systems Engineer</strong> and <strong>Technical Lead</strong> with over <strong>20 years</strong> of experience architecting scalable, reliable, and cost-effective cloud infrastructure solutions.
                        </p>

                                Operating at the intersection of software engineering and infrastructure, I build resilient platforms that empower engineering teams to move faster. My expertise spans multi-region networking, disaster recovery, infrastructure-as-code (IaC), and Kubernetes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                In strategic leadership roles—including <strong>Director of Network Operations</strong>—I have demonstrated a track record of defining technical strategy and building high-performing teams. Currently at <strong>Pinterest</strong>, I serve as the Directly Responsible Individual (DRI) for Multi-Region and Multi-Account initiatives, enabling global scale while optimizing costs and reliability.

                                I try to leave teams more infrastructure-literate than I found them. That means pairing architectural work with clear documentation, internal workshops, and mentorship so engineers can operate complex systems with confidence instead of fear.
                        </p>
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                                <li>Translating infrastructure strategy into language product, security, and data teams can act on</li>
                                <li>Raising the floor of infra literacy through talks, office hours, and pairing</li>
                                <li>Creating psychologically safe teams where engineers from underrepresented backgrounds can do their best work</li>
                        </ul>

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-16">
                        Recently my focus has been on scaling Kubernetes for AI workloads, designing multi-region architectures at Pinterest, and building safer AI tooling— including an AI Bridge MCP server and an AWS Security Group Mapper that help engineers reason about infrastructure more clearly.
