## The Story

I operate as an **Architect-Operator-Translator**—designing systems, building tooling, and carrying narratives to executives. This throughline defines my work: progressing from Staff to Senior Staff Tech Lead while owning Provisioning, Disaster Recovery services, and AWS Architecture at hyperscale.

### 2021: Building the Foundation

I joined as the technical center of gravity for Cloud Architecture. From day one, I revived stale DR tooling and designed the deployment platform DR strategy. I initiated the **IaC working group**, treating Infrastructure as Code as a first-class product rather than an afterthought. This set the standard that "nice-to-have" would not become "optional."

### 2022: Resilience Under Constraint

When IP address exhaustion threatened network growth, I built visibility tooling that gave teams insight into capacity before it became a crisis. I partnered with professional services to build DR tooling at **a fraction of vendor cost**—operational infrastructure, not theoretical exercises.

During a production incident, this investment paid off: recovery that would have taken weeks completed in hours. I aligned stakeholders on DR invariants—what must survive versus what can gracefully degrade—turning a potential catastrophe into a validation of our approach.

This year also saw team building: I partnered with recruiting to build a diverse team, mentoring engineers who would go on to lead their own initiatives.

### 2023: Reshaping How We Build

A major data engineering initiative required the first multi-account production workload. I led account structure design and VPC/networking architecture, creating patterns that would become the foundation for AWS organizational structure.

I identified that the Transit Gateway topology was incurring significant data transfer costs—costs that scaled linearly with growth. I converted the Prod-Data VPC from Transit Gateway to direct peering **without downtime or business interruption**, requiring coordination across networking, security, and finance teams.

I wrote and owned the **Cloud Architecture Strategy**, establishing the long-term vision for infrastructure investments.

### 2024: Executive Influence and Decision Quality

When multi-region expansion was considered, I led the cost analysis that revealed the true investment required. Rather than advocating for a specific outcome, I designed alternatives and presented options and tradeoffs **directly to the CTO and executive staff**. The analysis drove an executive decision to pause and redirect resources—sometimes the best infrastructure decision is knowing when not to build.

I created the **foundational technical design document** for AWS organization patterns, capturing guardrails that would guide future development.

### 2025: Execution at Scale

The **Next-Gen Network Architecture** delivered foundational components **ahead of schedule**. AWS IPAM and VPC visibility tooling now support substantial network growth, preventing the IP exhaustion crises that had previously threatened expansion.

The **centralized egress redesign** unlocked significant annual savings while improving security posture. I mentored a junior engineer on DR concurrency features for petabyte-scale jobs, turning operational requirements into growth opportunities.

### Provisioning at Hyperscale

Throughout my tenure, I led EC2 provisioning at hyperscale: large-scale compute infrastructure and petabytes of storage as one of AWS's largest enterprise customers. I oversaw multi-hierarchy image builder infrastructure and led the immutable infrastructure transition, ensuring the compute foundation could scale with the business.

When network capacity constrained growth, I **advocated directly to AWS senior leadership**, working collaboratively across company boundaries to secure the capacity increase needed.
