## Problem
The Quip Data Platform was facing reliability issues that impacted the availability of critical business insights. Additionally, the existing analytics infrastructure was batch-based, preventing real-time analysis of user interactions. The lack of real-time visibility meant product teams were flying blind during feature launches, and operational instability was causing excessive on-call burden.

## Approach
As the Technical Lead for Data Platform SRE, I focused on two main areas: hardening the existing infrastructure and modernizing the data pipeline.

### Reliability Engineering
I led a comprehensive reliability audit of the platform, identifying single points of failure and bottlenecks. We implemented better monitoring and alerting, and automated recovery processes.
- **Uptime:** These efforts resulted in a measurable 15% increase in overall system uptime.
- **Automation:** We automated the provisioning of all new infrastructure using Terraform, eliminating manual configuration drift.

### Real-Time Analytics
To enable real-time insights, I designed and built a new clickstream analytics pipeline.
- **Architecture:** We used AWS Kinesis for data ingestion, Lambda for serverless processing, and Athena for ad-hoc querying.
- **Impact:** This allowed product teams to see user behavior in real-time, enabling faster iteration.

## Outcomes
- **Stability:** The platform became significantly more stable, reducing on-call burden and improving trust with stakeholders.
- **Visibility:** The business gained new capabilities to understand user engagement as it happened.
- **Efficiency:** The move to ECS and serverless technologies lowered our run rate.
- **Cost Savings:** Migrated legacy applications to AWS ECS, which reduced operational overhead and costs by 20%.

## Key Contributions
- **Pipeline Development:** Architected and implemented the core logic for the Kinesis/Lambda pipeline.
- **Cost Optimization:** Led the migration of legacy services to AWS ECS, optimizing resource utilization.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Standardized Terraform usage across the data platform team.
- **Reliability Leadership:** Mentored the team on SRE best practices, shifting culture from reactive to proactive.
