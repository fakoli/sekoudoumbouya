## Problem

Starting new infrastructure projects often involves:

- **Recreating directory structures**: Every project needs similar organizational patterns for IaC, configuration management, and orchestration.
- **Setting up tooling from scratch**: Configuring Terraform backends, Ansible inventory structures, and Kubernetes manifests repeatedly.
- **Inconsistent practices**: Without a template, teams develop different conventions across projects.
- **Missing secrets management**: Secure handling of secrets is often an afterthought.

## Approach

I created a **template repository** that provides a production-ready structure for DevOps projects, incorporating lessons learned from years of infrastructure work.

### Directory Structure

```
devops-project-skeleton/
├── ansible/           # Configuration management
├── configs/           # Application configurations
├── kubernetes/
│   └── clusters/
│       └── k3s-local/ # Local K8s development
├── terraform/         # Infrastructure as Code
├── .sops.yaml         # Secrets encryption config
└── .gitignore
```

### Key Components

- **Terraform modules**
  Pre-structured for multi-environment deployments with proper state management and variable organization.

- **Ansible playbooks**
  Ready-to-use playbook structure with inventory patterns for different environments.

- **Kubernetes manifests**
  Local k3s cluster configuration for development and testing, following GitOps principles.

- **SOPS integration**
  Pre-configured secrets management using Mozilla SOPS for encrypting sensitive values in Git.

## Outcomes

- **Faster project bootstrapping**: New infrastructure projects start with proven patterns instead of from scratch.
- **Consistent conventions**: Teams using the template follow the same organizational structure.
- **Built-in best practices**: Secrets management, environment separation, and tooling integration are included by default.
- **GitHub template feature**: One-click repository creation for new projects.

## Key Contributions

- Designed a **comprehensive directory structure** based on production infrastructure patterns.
- Integrated **SOPS** for secure secrets management in version control.
- Created **reusable Terraform and Ansible patterns** that scale across environments.
- Documented **local Kubernetes development** setup with k3s.
- Published as a **GitHub template** for easy adoption.
