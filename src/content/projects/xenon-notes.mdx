## Problem

Traditional notetaking apps lack intelligent features that could help users:

- **Organize information automatically**: Users spend time manually categorizing and tagging notes.
- **Surface relevant context**: Finding related notes requires manual search and memory.
- **Leverage spatial interfaces**: Existing apps don't take advantage of new spatial computing capabilities.

## Approach

Xenon Notes is an **AI-powered notetaking app** built natively for Apple platforms, designed to make note management more intelligent and intuitive.

### Key Features

- **AI-powered organization**
  Leverages on-device machine learning to automatically categorize and tag notes based on content.

- **Native Apple experience**
  Built with SwiftUI for a responsive, native interface that follows Apple's Human Interface Guidelines.

- **RealityKit integration**
  Explores spatial computing capabilities for immersive note visualization and interaction.

- **Privacy-first design**
  AI processing happens on-device using Core ML, keeping user data private.

## Technical Highlights

- **100% Swift**: Native performance and tight platform integration.
- **SwiftUI architecture**: Declarative UI with reactive data flow.
- **RealityKit content**: Spatial computing features for visionOS compatibility.
- **Comprehensive testing**: XCTest suite for reliability.

## Outcomes

- Exploring the intersection of AI and spatial computing for productivity applications.
- Learning and applying the latest Apple platform technologies including visionOS and RealityKit.
- Building a foundation for AI-enhanced productivity tools on Apple platforms.

## Key Contributions

- Designed and implemented a **native Swift application** with AI capabilities.
- Integrated **RealityKit** for spatial computing features.
- Built a **privacy-first architecture** using on-device ML processing.
- Created a modern **SwiftUI-based interface** following Apple design guidelines.
