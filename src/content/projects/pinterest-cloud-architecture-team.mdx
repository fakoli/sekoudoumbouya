## Problem
Pinterest had strong infrastructure engineering teams, but lacked a coherent architectural function that could bridge long-term strategic direction with the day-to-day realities of distributed systems. Critical initiatives—multi-region design, networking modernization, IaC standards—required a north star, not scattered tribal knowledge. Without a unified architectural backbone, teams risked duplicated effort, inconsistent patterns, and slow adoption of best practices.

## Approach
I founded the **Pinterest Cloud Architecture Team** to establish the connective tissue between infrastructure strategy, engineering execution, and cross-org technical clarity.

The first step was defining a **team charter and pillars**, covering multi-region expansion, networking evolution, infrastructure services substrate, IaC safety, and cloud governance. This charter created organizational alignment, giving leadership a clear structure for understanding where architectural decisions lived.

Next, I built the team—mentoring **12–14 engineers directly** and influencing many others across SRE, Security, Infra Provisioning, and Data Engineering. Through workshops, code reviews, and internal education, I increased engineering literacy in cloud networking, IaC, multi-account design, and AWS infrastructure fundamentals.

I also led the creation of **Terraform and CI/CD guardrails**, ensuring deployments became safer, more predictable, and consistent across accounts. These guardrails helped unify operational behavior for the entire infrastructure layer.

## Outcomes
- Established a durable Cloud Architecture function  
- Improved organizational clarity around infrastructure strategy  
- Established IaC standards and Terraform CI/CD guardrails  
- Strengthened cloud networking and multi-region literacy across engineering  
- Raised the technical maturity of SRE, Security, and Infra Provisioning teams  
- Created repeatable architectural patterns adopted by multiple orgs  

## Key Contributions
- Defined team charter + strategic pillars  
- Mentored 12–14 direct reports + cross-team influence  
- Authored IaC best practices and Terraform safety patterns  
- Delivered org-wide cloud networking and IaC workshops  
- Bridged infra leadership, product teams, and platform engineering
