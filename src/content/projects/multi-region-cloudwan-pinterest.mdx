## Context

Pinterest serves users worldwide. As the platform grows, the network infrastructure must grow with it—not just in capacity, but in geographic reach. Teams need to deploy services globally without becoming networking experts.

When I took on the Multi-Region Global Architecture initiative in 2024, the goal was to establish the network patterns that would enable Pinterest's global presence. The infrastructure needed to be sophisticated enough to handle global traffic, yet simple enough that any team could adopt it.

## The Approach

### CloudWAN as the Global Backbone

AWS CloudWAN provides the foundation for Pinterest's multi-region connectivity:

- **Global network** spanning regions with unified management
- **Policy-driven routing** that simplifies cross-region traffic flows
- **Integrated segmentation** for network isolation where needed
- **Automated path selection** optimizing for latency and cost

CloudWAN abstracts the complexity of building a global network. Instead of managing individual peering connections and route tables across regions, teams work with a unified network that spans Pinterest's global footprint.

### Centralized Shared VPCs

Rather than every subaccount creating its own regional VPCs, we established centralized shared VPCs:

- **Regional hub VPCs** that subaccounts connect to
- **Shared services** accessible without cross-account networking complexity
- **Consistent CIDR allocation** through IPAM integration
- **Reduced network footprint** minimizing VPC sprawl

When a team needs network connectivity in a region, they connect to the shared VPC rather than building from scratch. The shared VPC handles the complexity of global connectivity.

### Terraform Modules for Organic Growth

The infrastructure patterns are encoded in Terraform modules that enable self-service:

- **Regional deployment modules** that handle CloudWAN integration
- **Subaccount connectivity modules** for joining the shared network
- **Guardrails** preventing common misconfigurations
- **Version-controlled patterns** with clear upgrade paths

Teams don't need to understand CloudWAN to use it. They request network access through the modules, and the modules handle the integration with the global infrastructure.

## Simplifying Adoption

The measure of success isn't the sophistication of the infrastructure—it's how easily teams can use it.

**Before:** Teams needing global connectivity would engage with the networking team, design custom solutions, and implement region-by-region.

**After:** Teams import a Terraform module, specify the regions they need, and deploy. The module handles CloudWAN integration, route propagation, and shared VPC connectivity.

This isn't just about convenience. When adoption is easy, teams actually adopt the patterns. When patterns are adopted consistently, the entire organization benefits from standardization.

## Enabling Global Presence

The infrastructure establishes the foundation for Pinterest's global operations:

- **Latency-optimized routing** directing traffic to the nearest region
- **Consistent security posture** across all regions
- **Unified observability** for global network health
- **Disaster recovery patterns** leveraging multi-region availability

## Execution

This initiative began in 2024 and continues as Pinterest expands its global footprint. The infrastructure is designed to grow organically—adding a new region doesn't require architectural changes, just deploying the established patterns in a new location.

Key to the execution:
- **Incremental rollout** starting with non-critical workloads
- **Clear documentation** explaining the patterns and their benefits
- **Collaborative design** with teams who will use the infrastructure
- **Continuous feedback** incorporating lessons learned into module improvements

## Results

- **Simplified multi-region connectivity** — Teams deploy globally without networking expertise
- **Reduced barrier to adoption** — Terraform modules abstract complexity
- **Consistent patterns** — Every regional deployment follows the same architecture
- **Foundation for growth** — Infrastructure scales with Pinterest's global expansion

## Key Learnings

**Simplicity is the feature.** The technical sophistication of CloudWAN matters less than whether teams can actually use it. The modules that hide complexity deliver more value than the infrastructure itself.

**Shared infrastructure reduces toil.** Centralized shared VPCs mean teams don't duplicate effort. One well-designed regional network serves many teams.

**Organic growth requires patterns.** Infrastructure that can grow without rewrites must be built on consistent patterns. The Terraform modules ensure that growth follows the same architectural principles.

**Documentation enables adoption.** Even the best infrastructure fails if teams don't understand how to use it. Clear documentation is as important as the infrastructure itself.
