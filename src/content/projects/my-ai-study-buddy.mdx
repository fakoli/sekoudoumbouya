## Problem

Traditional learning platforms often fail visual learners who need hands-on, interactive experiences to master complex subjects. Most existing solutions either focus purely on content delivery without adaptive learning mechanisms, or they lack the flexibility to generate personalized content at scale. Additionally, many educational tools don't leverage modern AI capabilities to create dynamic, context-aware learning experiences.

I needed to build a platform that combined the proven effectiveness of spaced repetition with AI-powered content generation, while maintaining the flexibility for users to control their own AI integrations. The challenge was creating a system that could serve both individual learners and administrators, with robust course authoring capabilities and progress tracking.

## Approach

I designed Study Buddy as a full-stack TypeScript and Python application, choosing FastAPI for the backend to leverage Python's rich AI ecosystem while maintaining high performance and automatic API documentation. The frontend uses React with Vite for fast development iteration and optimal build performance.

### Key Design Elements

- **Modular AI Integration**: Built adapters for both Claude (text generation) and Gemini (image generation) APIs, with user-configurable API keys to avoid vendor lock-in
- **Flexible Storage Layer**: Implemented abstracted storage backends supporting JSON files for development, SQLite for single-user deployments, and Supabase for production multi-tenant scenarios
- **Spaced Repetition Engine**: Developed a sophisticated flashcard review system that adapts to individual learning patterns and retention rates
- **Markdown-Based Content**: Used Markdown for course content to enable version control, easy editing, and seamless integration with existing documentation workflows
- **Comprehensive API**: Architected 74+ REST endpoints across 12 resource categories, providing full CRUD operations for all learning components

The architecture separates concerns cleanly, with Pydantic v2 models ensuring type safety across the Python backend, while TypeScript provides end-to-end type safety in the React frontend. I implemented role-based access control with JWT authentication and built an admin console for user management and system monitoring.

## Outcomes

- **Complete Learning Management System**: Delivered a full-featured platform supporting flashcards, quizzes, structured courses, learning paths, and progress tracking with AI-powered content generation
- **Flexible Deployment Options**: Achieved seamless scaling from local development (JSON storage) to production environments (Supabase) with the same codebase
- **User-Controlled AI Integration**: Enabled learners to use their own AI API keys, reducing operational costs while providing access to cutting-edge language models
- **Extensible Architecture**: Built modular components that support multiple content types, assessment methods, and notification systems

## Key Contributions

- **Architected comprehensive FastAPI backend** with 74+ endpoints across authentication, content management, AI generation, and administration
- **Implemented sophisticated spaced repetition algorithm** that tracks user performance and optimizes review scheduling for maximum retention
- **Built multi-provider AI integration system** supporting Claude for text generation and Gemini for visual content creation
- **Designed flexible storage abstraction layer** enabling seamless transitions between JSON, SQLite, and Supabase backends
- **Created intuitive course authoring system** with Markdown support, module reordering, and automated progress tracking
- **Developed role-based admin console** with user management, token administration, and comprehensive system monitoring
