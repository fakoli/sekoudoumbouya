## Problem

Large Language Model applications increasingly rely on Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to extend their capabilities with external tools and data sources. However, managing multiple MCP servers creates significant operational complexity - each server requires separate configuration, authentication, and monitoring. LLM clients must maintain connections to numerous endpoints, handle different authentication schemes, and lack visibility into tool usage patterns and performance metrics.

Existing solutions forced developers to either embed multiple MCP servers directly into applications or manage complex client-side routing logic. Neither approach provided centralized authentication, comprehensive analytics, or the ability to control access to specific tools based on user roles. This fragmentation made it difficult to scale MCP-powered applications in production environments.

I needed a solution that would act as a unified gateway, providing secure access to multiple MCP servers while offering the operational visibility and control required for production deployments.

## Approach

I designed MCP Gateway as a centralized proxy that sits between LLM clients and MCP servers, implementing namespace-based routing to cleanly separate different tool categories. The architecture uses Go's excellent concurrency model to handle multiple simultaneous connections while maintaining low latency for real-time LLM interactions.

The core routing system maps namespace prefixes to backend MCP servers, allowing clients to access filesystem tools via `/mcp/filesystem` and search tools via `/mcp/search` through a single gateway endpoint. This approach eliminates client-side complexity while providing clear service boundaries.

For authentication, I implemented an API key system that supports both global and namespace-restricted access. Each key can be configured to allow access only to specific namespaces, enabling fine-grained security controls. The middleware pipeline processes authentication, rate limiting, and logging in a composable fashion.

### Key Design Elements

- **Namespace-based routing**: Clean separation of MCP servers by functional domain
- **Embedded analytics**: DuckDB provides fast querying of request logs without external dependencies  
- **SSE streaming proxy**: Full support for Server-Sent Events to maintain MCP protocol compatibility
- **Tool filtering**: Per-namespace allow/deny lists for granular access control
- **Environment-aware configuration**: YAML with environment variable expansion for flexible deployment

## Outcomes

The gateway successfully unifies access to multiple MCP servers through a single endpoint, dramatically simplifying client configuration and reducing connection overhead. The embedded analytics engine provides real-time insights into tool usage patterns, user behavior, and system performance without requiring external monitoring infrastructure.

Production deployments benefit from comprehensive rate limiting, structured logging, and namespace isolation that enables secure multi-tenant access. The SSE streaming support ensures full compatibility with the MCP protocol while adding the operational benefits of centralized management.

## Key Contributions
