## Problem
Pinterest’s legacy AWS network leaned heavily on centralized transit gateways and broad, interconnected routing domains. While workable at moderate scale, this model inflated cross-zone data transfer costs, amplified blast radius during network events, and created operational ambiguity. As Pinterest’s traffic patterns grew more global and multi-account strategy solidified, the network no longer aligned with the company’s reliability, cost, or scaling goals.

## Approach
I led the architecture for Pinterest’s **Next-Generation Network (NGN)**—a shift toward a distributed, predictable, cost-efficient model grounded in modern cloud networking principles.

The redesign centered on **centralized connectivity with distributed control**. Instead of treating the network as a single global fabric, we defined clear regional routing domains with isolated blast radii. This allowed each region to operate with its own control-plane boundaries while still benefiting from centrally governed egress, security layers, and shared services.

A critical component was the analysis of **AZ balance and data transfer economics**. By modeling traffic paths and understanding how AWS charges for east-west movement, I demonstrated that the transit gateway–centric model was structurally misaligned with Pinterest’s architecture. This informed the recommendation—later adopted—to migrate toward **direct VPC peering**, simplified edge routing, and clearer account-level segmentation.

## Outcomes
- Eliminated \$10M in annual AWS transit gateway and data transfer costs  
- Reduced network blast radius by decentralizing routing domains  
- Improved observability and operational safety around edge and inter-VPC traffic  
- Established a foundation that supports future multi-region expansion  
- Simplified governance by aligning cloud networking with the multi-account model  

## Key Contributions
- Architected NGN and modeled routing control-plane boundaries  
- Performed deep AZ-balancing and cost-transfer analysis  
- Designed the shift from Transit Gateway → direct VPC peering  
- Standardized centralized egress + distributed control patterns  
- Influenced long-term networking roadmap adopted by Engineering Leadership
