## Problem
Pinterest was reaching the natural limits of a single-region model. As global traffic increased and reliability expectations tightened, the existing infrastructure lacked a coherent way to define, build, and operate regions. “Multi-region” existed in discussion but not as a programmable, repeatable system. Service teams, security, and platform engineering all carried different assumptions about what a new region required, creating ambiguity in planning and risk in execution.

## Approach
I reframed multi-region expansion as an orchestration problem rather than a collection of one-off infrastructure tasks. The core step was introducing **region types**—Lightweight, Full, and Read-Only—giving the organization a taxonomy to anchor decisions. This definition allowed us to reason clearly about control-plane replication, data locality, and failure boundaries.

From there, I proposed a **spec-driven Region Artifact**: a single, declarative document expressing all requirements—network boundaries, account layout, IAM rules, sidecar dependencies, service discovery configuration, and workload readiness steps. The Region Artifact became the blueprint for automation and cross-team alignment.

I then developed a **four-phase orchestration model**:

1. **Landing Zone** – accounts, org units, baselines, and guardrails  
2. **Network** – VPC layout, IPAM, routing, peering, centralized egress  
3. **Infrastructure Services Substrate** – service discovery, security sidecars, observability, shared clusters  
4. **Workloads & Routing** – Envoy routing, onboarding flows, traffic readiness  

This phased model allowed product teams, SRE, and security to understand exactly where their systems fit.

## Outcomes
- A unified organizational understanding of multi-region and multi-account strategy  
- Executable roadmap for Pinterest’s 2026+ regional expansion  
- Reduced engineering ambiguity by providing a contract between infra and product teams  
- Stronger reliability posture by reducing control-plane single points of failure  
- More predictable region build timelines and cost modeling  

## Key Contributions
- DRI for multi-region and multi-account strategy  
- Defined region types (Lightweight, Full, Read-Only)  
- Authored Region Spec artifact concept  
- Created four-phase region orchestration model  
- Drove alignment across SRE, Security, Data Engineering, and Leadership  
- Enabled Spark on EKS multi-account evolution
