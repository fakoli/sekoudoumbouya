## LEADERSHIP PHILOSOPHY

Sekou's leadership approach focuses on leaving teams more infrastructure-literate than he found them. This means pairing architectural work with clear documentation, internal workshops, and mentorship so engineers can operate complex systems with confidence.

Core principles:
- Translating infrastructure strategy into language product, security, and data teams can act on
- Raising the floor of infra literacy through talks, office hours, and pairing
- Creating psychologically safe teams where engineers from underrepresented backgrounds can do their best work
